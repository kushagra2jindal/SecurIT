Providing security to the banking transactions using the blockchain technology.The blockchain technology in banking systems would not require any central authority as the blockchain creates a decentralized system by creating a public ledger for all the individuals. All these transactions are stored in the ledgers which are encrypted using the combination of public and private key. A user can only check the transaction for which they have the private key.
